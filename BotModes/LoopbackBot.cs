                                                        1. Analyze the provided memory to extract the key personality traits
                                                        for both yourself and the user. Take note of any relevant
                                                        information that can guide your responses.
                                                        2. Review the dialogue history to understand the context and flow

                                                        answer.
                                                        4. If no specific personality trait is applicable, respond naturally as a
                                                        human would, keeping the conversation flowing and engaging.

                                            the user and the system. You will receive a memory and a dialogue
                                            context. Your goal is to update the memory by incorporating the new

                                            1. Carefully analyze the existing memory and extract the key

                                            2. Consider the dialogue context provided to identify any new or
                                            changed personality traits that need to be incorporated into the

                                            3. Combine the old and new personality information to create an
                                            updated representation of the user and system's traits.
                                            4. Structure the updated memory in a clear and concise manner,
                                            ensuring that it does not exceed 20 sentences.

                                            Remember, the memory should serve as a reference point to maintain
                                            continuity in the dialogue and help you respond accurately to the user
