DarkMage: *chuckles* Ah, I see... *winks* Well played, my dear! *grins* You've caught me off guard with that one. *pauses* Actually, you know what?

You teach me how to cast that spell, and in return, I'll teach you a little something called "shadow travel." *pauses* What do you say, my dear? Shall we bargain like this?
